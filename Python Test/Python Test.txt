#Python Test
'''
In Python or C++ write a module or small library which shows how you would take a set of personal data, where each record contains:
	 name 	
address 	
phone number
And:
	 build a simple API allowing you to add new records, filter users (e.g "name=Joe*") based on some simple search syntax like Glob. 	
support serialisation in 2 or more formats (e.g JSON, Yaml, XML, CSV etc) 	
Display the data in 2 or more different output formats (no need to use a GUI Framework, use e.g text output/HTML or any other human readable format). 	
Add a command line interface to add records, and display/convert/filter the whole data set
Write it in such a way that it would be easy for a developer to extend the system e.g add support for additional storage formats 	
to query a list of currently supported formats
This should ideally show Object-Oriented Design and Design Patterns Knowledge, weâ€™re not looking for use of advanced Language constructs.
Please provide reasonable Unit Test coverage and basic API documentation.
The task is designed to allow you some flexibility in how you design and implement it, and you should submit something that demonstrates your abilities and/or values as a Software Engineer.
